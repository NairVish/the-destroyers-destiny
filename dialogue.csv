"It is the year 2215. You are what they call an Unknown, part of the lower class in your home city. Unknowns have no way of going up the social ladder because they are not trusted enough to carry out the most lucrative bounty jobs. Only the Knowns, the upper class, can carry out bounty quests and can help people.",c,0
"It's ironic. Don't you agree? You have to perform these jobs to get anywhere in the world, but to do them, you have to be someone in this world. A Known.",p,0
"So you go about your business.",m,0
"As you go about your normal business (or lack thereof), you start to hear rumors of communications with extraterrestrial races. Some are saying it's with a race called the Valst'r. You've never heard of them. People you have talked to have never heard of them. So, you continue with your life. Funnily enough, there aren't any mentions in the media about this...",m_1,0
"You go to sleep for another night. You've been having nightmares for a while now and haven't been able to sleep well. Tonight, you're having strange dreams of your home being bombed...",p,0
"The next morning you hear a small rumbling in the distance. These rumblings grow louder and louder and eventually turn into explosions. You rush outside to see what on Nira's going on. You observe these (frankly weird-looking) creatures, and you realize that your dreams were foreshadowing this all along...and that the rumors were all true...",c,0
"There really are aliens coming to destroy your home planet, Nira.",p,0
"One of them shoots toward you. You manage to dodge it, but it hits an Imperial Soldier just running behind you.",c,0
"You go to check on him. With his dying breath, he tells you to take one of the weapons he's carrying, because you're going to need it to protect yourself.",p,0
"You find three generic weapons on his body, but carrying all three is going to slow you down unnecessarily. Which one do you choose?",sw,0
"You also get some health potions.",p,0
"You start off and fight your way through the city.",d,0
"Eventually, you reach the city center and see that (what seems to be) the leader of these alien forces is about to execute the governor of the province!",c_interrupt,0
"You could choose to fight him (you have a weapon anyway), or you could stand back and let someone else do it.",c,0
"What do you decide?",rn,0
"Challenge the leader!",r,16
"Stay back.",r,17
"You decide to challenge the leader to a fight.",b,19
"One of the generals of the Imperial Forces steps in, but he is killed. Since you are the only capable fighter around, you are forced to fight the leader; however, he was weakened in his fight with the general.",b,19
"The aliens retreat with their leader dead.",p,0
"As a sign of gratitude, the governor promotes you to a Known. He also gives you a great amount of gold. In the days after, you hear that the aliens who invaded are called the Valst'r.",p,0
"<Player Note: You can now access bounty quests! Use these to get some money and level up. It is also recommended to eventually upgrade your weapon.>",m,0
"You have been invited to the provincial governor's palace. Apparently, the empire is forming an army to storm a Valst'r camp not too far. Considering how you did a few days before, the empire is more than willing to bring you along for the ride.",p,0
"You are eventually brought into a briefing for the assault and are assigned an assistant. Her name is Merlona. She's of a different breed of human. After humans began expanding beyond Earth a hundred years ago, they had to adapt to conditions that were significantly different than those on Earth. Advances in biological research allowed humans to develop the traits necessary to survive these conditions. Then, due to whatever problems (war, famine, etc.), people began to migrate between planets, making each one very diverse.",c,0
"Merlona knows all about the Valst'r camp. She has spent days studying intelligence reports as well as reports on the layout of the camp.",p,0
"It's finally time to assault the base. You and your assistant are with the fifth wave of the assualt on the base.",p,0
"You reach the entrance to the base and are under heavy fire.",p,0
"Merlona: OK. The two of us can either attack straight through the front *or* sneak in through the back. It's your call.",rn,0
"Let's charge through the front. (Shorter)",r,30
"Let's sneak in through the back. (Longer)",r,31
"Through the front? Get ready to do a lot of fighting...",d_fight,32
"Through the back? Remember to be quiet as we do this...",d_sneak,32
"You eventually reach the center, where you are confronted by the Commander-in-Chief of the Valst'r forces.",c_interrupt,0
"You don't quite know his name, but you notice that he is a rather bulky individual.",p,0
"An exchange takes place. Surprisingly, the Valst'r also speak English.",p,0
"So, the destroyer arrives...",rn,0
"Wait, who?",r,37
"You don't know? Hmph, I never expected the Destroyer to be so...uninformed.",rn,0
"Spit it out, already!",r,40
"(remain silent)",r,41
"Impatient too? Interesting...I'll tell you.",p,42
"You're admitting it? Eh, I'll still tell you.",p,42
"You see, the Valst'r have this legend of sorts. Actually, they have many legends, but this one is special.",c,0
"Long story short, it tells of a Destroyer, who will eventually end the Valst'r race.",c,0
"However, our court mages were able to track down the Destroyer's aura to this planet, Nira!",rn,0
"You don't mean...",r,46
"Yes, we came here to destroy you and your entire race!",c,0
"But since you don't seem too imposing. I'll leave my assistant here to destroy you.",p,0
"(He teleports off.)",b,0
"After the battle, the rest of the army slaughters the Valst'r at the base. You have wiped out the Valst'r army camp! All seems to be well for the time being. You and Merlona are dismissed from duties with high praise.",c,0
"On your way back home, Merlona asks you something...",p,0
"Merlona: I was meaning to ask you something. You see, the Valstr's first attack completely destroyed my home.",c,0
"I was wondering if I could stay at your place for a while. I promise I won't bother you.",rn,0
"Sure! You can stay with me! I don't mind. (Honestly speaking, it's the least you could do for her help...)",r,54
"Oh! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I promise you won't regret it.",p,0
"<Player Note: Merlona has moved in with you! She can now accompany you on your sidequests and will make small, random amounts of money every day.>",m,0
"After a couple of days of rest, you and your assistant are invited to the Imperial Palace. If you're being invited to the palace, then this must be important...",c,0
"The two of you are being briefed by the Commander of the Imperial forces. The plan?",p,0
"The Commander: After much thought and deliberation, we have come to this decision:",c,0
"We are going to launch two missiles loaded with Hexonium. As you may or may not know, the fission and fusion reactions of Hexonium are extremely powerful. So powerful, in fact, that they are thousands to millions of times more powerful than the atomic bombs that were created a couple of hundred years ago.",c,0
"Which means... (He looks at you intently.)",p,0
"That we can destroy the Valst'r home planet hundreds of times over and wipe them from the face of the universe.",rn,0
"Uhh...",r,64
"Wait, how do you know where these guys are?",r,65
"I'll take that as sign of understanding. And, yes, we know where the Valst'r home planet is. I'll tell you how we know.",c,0
"You see, we have been engaging in 'diplomacy' talks with the Valst'r for years now. They were angry about something and demanded to enslave everyone on Nira. Then suddenly, they invade us. We didn't even know why until just a few days back when they called you the 'Destroyer' or something...",rn,0
"And how do you expect these missiles to get there in time? If I'm correct, then the nearest *star* is light-years away.",r,67
"Ah, you underestimate us there. Surely, you've heard that nothing can go past the speed of light. Well, that's rubbish! We've created something called a 'warp drive.' Basically, we've found a way to configure the energy-density field around these missiles such that...",rn,0
"OK! OK! What on Nira do you want us to do?",r,69
"It's simple. You and your assistant here are going to launch these missiles.",rn,0
"Uhh...Why can't you just do it yourself?",r,71
"That's exactly why we need you! The Valst'r have blocked the road leading to the missile launch site and have killed all of the employees there. You have to get there before they manage to dismantle the missiles, and then you have to launch them. That's all you two have to do. Sounds easy, right?",rn,0
"I mean, it *sounds* easy, but I understand.",r,73
"Merlona: I understand too.",p,0
"Oh, and one more thing. The missile launch system is going to ask for a password to actually launch the missiles. The password is:",c,0
"valstrDestroy",d,0
"You reach the central room and encounter the Commander-in-Chief of the Valst'r forces...once again",c_interrupt,0
"Leader: So, you've finally reached me...",c,0
"Let's get to the point here. (unsheathes weapons)",p,0
"Prepare to die!",b,0
"Merlona: So, he's dead?",rn,0
"Looks like it.",r,0
"Phew...that's a relief.",rn,0
"Quick! There's no time. We have to launch the missiles before they send reinforcements here.",r,0
"Right, let's go.",p,0
"The two of you enter the missile control room. It's full of screens and buttons of various sorts. But one screen in particular stands out to you. You press the button next to it and are greeted with a terminal prompt.",term,0
"You imagine the two Hexonium missiles detonating, sending out explosions so powerful that anything and everything on the surface and underground are wiped out in the blink of an eye. But, at the moment, a wave of relief washes over you. You've just saved yourself...but you've also just saved the entirety of Nira from total enslaving and destruction.",c,0
"You hear your assistant letting out a huge sigh of relief, and you know everything will be alright.",p,0
"In the following days, you and Merlona are considered international heroes. The two of you are given many awards, titles, gadgets, and other stuff that you eventually lose track of everything.",c,0
"Soon, everything goes back to normal.",p,0
"At home, you are at peace because the Valst'r are no more and you, as the Destroyer, have fulfilled your destiny.",p,0
"Congratulations, you have finished the main questline and have saved the world from utter destruction! Feel free to continue playing the side quests.\nI hope you enjoyed playing this game!",m,0
